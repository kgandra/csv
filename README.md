# csv
Program to write into and read from csv file in java

Problem statement:
-----------------
There are two products in a store with different properties each.
Product    : Powder
Properties : Amount
             Composition
             Colour
             ExpiryDate
             Price
Product    : Lipstick
Properties : Shade
             Brand
             State
             ExpiryDate
             Price
             
For simplicity, I have just considered two products.
Every product have an attribute called price.
Now we are going to write a program where we are going to store the product details in a csv file.
This file can contain more than 1 row for same product. (Eg: There can be more than one lipstick from different brands and different shades in the store)
So after writing into the file, while reading from the file, the product name is taken as input from user and based on the input, all the list of products with that name are displayed and also the expensive one is also dispayed.
